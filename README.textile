h1. Foreman-mcollective

h3. A mcollective discovery plugin that finds information about your nodes in Foreman.

h2. Settings

This repository includes the bare minimum files to make a foreman discovery plugin work.
Normally you would set up the foreman url and certificates with puppet using the 
template provided in templates/config.cfg.erb. 
You may use Kerberized access to foreman by setting plugin.foreman.use_krb to 1 or true in the config file.
You can also take that file, modify it yourself, put it in /etc/mcollective/client.cfg  
and use it as a standalone, non-puppetized plugin.

h2. Usage

Fetch hosts given a sample condition
<pre> $ mco xxxxx --dm=foreman --do='hostgroup = samplehostgroup' </pre>

Fetch hosts given several conditions 
<pre> $ mco xxxxx --dm=foreman --do='params.owner = owner1 AND ip=127.0.0.1' </pre>
